0,6,"Due to improper authorization, Red Hat Single Sign-On is vulnerable to users performing actions that they should not be allowed to perform. It was possible to add users to the master realm even though no respective permission was granted."
1,6,"A flaw was found in Keycloak before version 12.0.0, where it is possible to add unsafe schemes for the redirect_uri parameter. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a Cross-site scripting attack."
2,6,"A flaw was found in Keycloak before 13.0.0, where it is possible to force the server to call out an unverified URL using the OIDC parameter request_uri. This flaw allows an attacker to use this parameter to execute a Server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack."
3,6,"A flaw was found in Keycloak before version 12.0.0, where it is possible to add unsafe schemes for the redirect_uri parameter. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a Cross-site scripting attack."
4,6,"A vulnerability was found in keycloak, where path traversal using URL-encoded path segments in the request is possible because the resources endpoint applies a transformation of the url path to the file path. Only few specific folder hierarchies can be exposed by this flaw"
5,6,"It was found that Keycloak before version 12.0.0 would permit a user with only view-profile role to manage the resources in the new account console, allowing access and modification of data the user was not intended to have."
6,6,A flaw was found in Keycloak before version 12.0.0 where it is possible to update the user's metadata attributes using Account REST API. This flaw allows an attacker to change its own NameID attribute to impersonate the admin user for any particular application.
7,6,A flaw was found in keycloak as shipped in Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4 where IDN homograph attacks are possible. A malicious user can register himself with a name already registered and trick admin to grant him extra privileges.
8,6,"A flaw was found in Keycloak. This flaw allows a privileged attacker to use the malicious payload as the group name while creating a new group from the admin console, leading to a stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack."
9,6,"keycloak: path traversal via double URL encoding. A flaw was found in Keycloak, where it does not properly validate URLs included in a redirect. An attacker can use this flaw to construct a malicious request to bypass validation and access other URLs and potentially sensitive information within the domain or possibly conduct further attacks. This flaw affects any client that utilizes a wildcard in the Valid Redirect URIs field."
10,6,A flaw was found in keycloak. The new account console in keycloak can allow malicious code to be executed using the referrer URL. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
11,6,"A Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in keycloak as shipped in Red Hat Single Sign-On 7. This flaw allows a privileged attacker to execute malicious scripts in the admin console, abusing the default roles functionality."
12,6,"A flaw was found in infinispan 10 REST API, where authorization permissions are not checked while performing some server management operations. When authz is enabled, any user with authentication can perform operations like shutting down the server without the ADMIN role."
13,6,"Both Spring Security 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.0 and the Spring Framework 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x rely on URL pattern mappings for authorization and for mapping requests to controllers respectively. Differences in the strictness of the pattern matching mechanisms, for example with regards to space trimming in path segments, can lead Spring Security to not recognize certain paths as not protected that are in fact mapped to Spring MVC controllers that should be protected. The problem is compounded by the fact that the Spring Framework provides richer features with regards to pattern matching as well as by the fact that pattern matching in each Spring Security and the Spring Framework can easily be customized creating additional differences."
14,6,"Spring Security (Spring Security 4.1.x before 4.1.5, 4.2.x before 4.2.4, and 5.0.x before 5.0.1; and Spring Framework 4.3.x before 4.3.14 and 5.0.x before 5.0.3) does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with special encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. In this particular attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed."
15,6,"An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Security before 3.2.10, 4.1.x before 4.1.4, and 4.2.x before 4.2.1. Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded ""/"" to a request, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed. Users of Apache Tomcat (all current versions) are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value returned by getContextPath(), getServletPath(), and getPathInfo(). Users of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified. Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.x are known to be affected. Users of other containers that implement the Servlet specification may be affected."
