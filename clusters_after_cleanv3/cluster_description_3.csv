0,3,"A flaw was found in all resteasy 3.x.x versions prior to 3.12.0.Final and all resteasy 4.x.x versions prior to 4.6.0.Final, where an improper input validation results in returning an illegal header that integrates into the server's response. This flaw may result in an injection, which leads to unexpected behavior when the HTTP response is constructed."
1,3,A flaw was found in RESTEasy in all versions of RESTEasy up to 4.6.0.Final. The endpoint class and method names are returned as part of the exception response when RESTEasy cannot convert one of the request URI path or query values to the matching JAX-RS resource method's parameter value. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
2,3,A flaw was found in RESTEasy client in all versions of RESTEasy up to 4.5.6.Final. It may allow client users to obtain the server's potentially sensitive information when the server got WebApplicationException from the RESTEasy client call. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
3,3,A flaw was found in keycloak in versions prior to 13.0.0. The client registration endpoint allows fetching information about PUBLIC clients (like client secret) without authentication which could be an issue if the same PUBLIC client changed to CONFIDENTIAL later. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
4,3,A flaw was found in keycloak affecting versions 11.0.3 and 12.0.0. An expired certificate would be accepted by the direct-grant authenticator because of missing time stamp validations. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.
5,3,A flaw was found in RESTEasy client in all versions of RESTEasy up to 4.5.6.Final. It may allow client users to obtain the server's potentially sensitive information when the server got WebApplicationException from the RESTEasy client call. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
