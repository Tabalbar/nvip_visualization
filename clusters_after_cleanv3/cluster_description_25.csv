0,25,"A flaw was found in wildfly-core in all versions. If a vault expression is in the form of a single attribute that contains multiple expressions, a user who was granted access to the management interface can potentially access a vault expression they should not be able to access and possibly retrieve the item which was stored in the vault. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data confidentiality and integrity."
1,25,"A memory leak flaw was found in WildFly in all versions up to 21.0.0.Final, where host-controller tries to reconnect in a loop, generating new connections which are not properly closed while not able to connect to domain-controller. This flaw allows an attacker to cause an Out of memory (OOM) issue, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
2,25,"A flaw was found in jboss-remoting in versions before 5.0.20.SP1-redhat-00001. A malicious attacker could cause threads to hold up forever in the EJB server by writing a sequence of bytes corresponding to the expected messages of a successful EJB client request, but omitting the ACK messages, or just tamper with jboss-remoting code, deleting the lines that send the ACK message from the EJB client code resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
3,25,"A flaw was found in Wildfly Elytron in versions prior to 1.10.14.Final, prior to 1.15.5.Final and prior to 1.16.1.Final where ScramServer may be susceptible to Timing Attack if enabled. The highest threat of this vulnerability is confidentiality."
4,25,"wildfly-elytron: possible timing attacks via use of unsafe comparator. A flaw was found in Wildfly-elytron. Wildfly-elytron uses java.util.Arrays.equals in several places, which is unsafe and vulnerable to timing attacks. To compare values securely, use java.security.MessageDigest.isEqual instead. This flaw allows an attacker to access secure information or impersonate an authed user."
5,25,Get requests in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 7 disclose internal IP addresses to remote attackers.
6,25,"A vulnerability was found in Wildfly in versions before 20.0.0.Final, where a remote deserialization attack is possible in the Enterprise Application Beans(EJB) due to lack of validation/filtering capabilities in wildfly."

12,25,A flaw was found in wildfly. The EJBContext principle is not popped back after invoking another EJB using a different Security Domain. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity. Versions before wildfly 20.0.0.Final are affected.
13,25,"A flaw was found in JBoss-client. The vulnerability occurs due to a memory leak on the JBoss client-side, when using UserTransaction repeatedly and leads to information leakage vulnerability."
