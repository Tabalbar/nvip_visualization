0,2,"A flaw was found in FasterXML Jackson Databind, where it did not have entity expansion secured properly. This flaw allows vulnerability to XML external entity (XXE) attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data integrity."
1,2,jackson-databind before 2.13.0 allows a Java StackOverflow exception and denial of service via a large depth of nested objects.
2,2,"In FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.14.0-rc1, resource exhaustion can occur because of a lack of a check in primitive value deserializers to avoid deep wrapper array nesting, when the UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS feature is enabled. Additional fix version in 2.13.4.1 and 2.12.17.1"
3,2,"In FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.13.4, resource exhaustion can occur because of a lack of a check in BeanDeserializer._deserializeFromArray to prevent use of deeply nested arrays. An application is vulnerable only with certain customized choices for deserialization."
4,2,jackson-databind 2.10.x through 2.12.x before 2.12.6 and 2.13.x before 2.13.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (2 GB transient heap usage per read) in uncommon situations involving JsonNode JDK serialization.

6,2,"Fasterxml Jackson version Before 2.9.8 contains a CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Jackson-Modules-Java8 that can result in Causes a denial-of-service (DoS). This attack appear to be exploitable via The victim deserializes malicious input, specifically very large values in the nanoseconds field of a time value. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 2.9.8."
