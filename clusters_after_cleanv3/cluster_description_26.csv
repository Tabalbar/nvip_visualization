0,26,"A flaw was discovered in all versions of Undertow before Undertow 2.2.0.Final, where HTTP request smuggling related to CVE-2017-2666 is possible against HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 due to permitting invalid characters in an HTTP request. This flaw allows an attacker to poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from request other than their own."
1,26,"A flaw was discovered in Undertow in versions before Undertow 2.1.1.Final where certain requests to the ""Expect: 100-continue"" header may cause an out of memory error. This flaw may potentially lead to a denial of service."
