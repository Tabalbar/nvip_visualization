On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability.

When this happens, the ByteBuffer containing the HTTP response headers is released back to the ByteBufferPool twice. Because of this double release, two threads can acquire the same ByteBuffer from the pool and while thread1 is about to use the ByteBuffer to write response1 data, thread2 fills the ByteBuffer with other data. Thread1 then proceeds to write the buffer that now contains different data. This results in client1, which issued request1 seeing data from another request or response which could contain sensitive data belonging to client2 (HTTP session ids, authentication credentials, etc.).

In affected versions a prepared statement using either `PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)` or `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)` will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k. This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability.

The PGJDBC implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user. User applications that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted. User application that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet. Note that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user.

The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy files from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.","453":"When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, or a derived formats, an Apache Ant build can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that leads to an out of memory error, even for small inputs. This can be used to disrupt builds using Apache Ant. Commonly used derived formats from ZIP archives are for instance JAR files and many office files. Apache Ant prior to 1.9.16 and 1.10.11 were affected."},"label":{"0":0,"1":1,"2":2,"3":2,"4":2,"5":2,"6":2,"7":3,"8":3,"9":4,"10":5,"11":1,"12":6,"13":7,"14":8,"15":8,"16":9,"17":10,"18":11,"19":12,"20":12,"21":12,"22":12,"23":12,"24":6,"25":13,"26":13,"27":14,"28":15,"29":3,"30":16,"31":0,"32":9,"33":10,"34":11,"35":12,"36":12,"37":12,"38":12,"39":12,"40":17,"41":18,"42":17,"43":17,"44":17,"45":-1,"46":-1,"47":6,"48":6,"49":6,"50":6,"51":13,"52":6,"53":3,"54":3,"55":8,"56":13,"57":6,"58":13,"59":13,"60":13,"61":13,"62":-1,"63":6,"64":13,"65":19,"66":20,"67":6,"68":13,"69":19,"70":13,"71":13,"72":6,"73":6,"74":2,"75":21,"76":21,"77":6,"78":8,"79":8,"80":18,"81":18,"82":5,"83":22,"84":23,"85":13,"86":24,"87":24,"88":24,"89":24,"90":24,"91":24,"92":-1,"93":5,"94":25,"95":25,"96":25,"97":25,"98":25,"99":25,"100":26,"101":26,"102":26,"103":26,"104":26,"105":26,"106":5,"107":5,"108":26,"109":26,"110":26,"111":25,"112":3,"113":15,"114":27,"115":20,"116":28,"117":5,"118":29,"119":30,"120":31,"121":32,"122":33,"123":34,"124":35,"125":7,"126":36,"127":37,"128":36,"129":36,"130":7,"131":38,"132":39,"133":34,"134":40,"135":36,"136":27,"137":20,"138":28,"139":29,"140":30,"141":31,"142":32,"143":5,"144":5,"145":5,"146":5,"147":5,"148":5,"149":29,"150":5,"151":5,"152":5,"153":5,"154":5,"155":5,"156":5,"157":25,"158":25,"159":25,"160":25,"161":25,"162":33,"163":34,"164":35,"165":36,"166":37,"167":36,"168":36,"169":36,"170":7,"171":38,"172":39,"173":33,"174":34,"175":40,"176":36,"177":33,"178":34,"179":35,"180":36,"181":37,"182":36,"183":36,"184":7,"185":38,"186":39,"187":33,"188":34,"189":40,"190":36,"191":33,"192":41,"193":34,"194":35,"195":5,"196":7,"197":36,"198":37,"199":36,"200":36,"201":36,"202":7,"203":38,"204":39,"205":33,"206":34,"207":40,"208":36,"209":4,"210":29,"211":42,"212":42,"213":42,"214":12,"215":1,"216":6,"217":6,"218":43,"219":43,"220":43,"221":44,"222":45,"223":6,"224":6,"225":43,"226":43,"227":43,"228":43,"229":43,"230":43,"231":43,"232":43,"233":46,"234":46,"235":43,"236":43,"237":43,"238":47,"239":48,"240":24,"241":6,"242":6,"243":9,"244":10,"245":11,"246":12,"247":12,"248":12,"249":12,"250":12,"251":20,"252":5,"253":49,"254":50,"255":46,"256":43,"257":43,"258":44,"259":45,"260":51,"261":43,"262":43,"263":43,"264":43,"265":8,"266":33,"267":34,"268":43,"269":47,"270":48,"271":6,"272":6,"273":9,"274":10,"275":11,"276":12,"277":12,"278":12,"279":12,"280":12,"281":2,"282":49,"283":50,"284":46,"285":43,"286":43,"287":43,"288":43,"289":43,"290":44,"291":51,"292":43,"293":45,"294":43,"295":43,"296":43,"297":47,"298":45,"299":48,"300":47,"301":45,"302":44,"303":43,"304":43,"305":43,"306":48,"307":14,"308":52,"309":53,"310":54,"311":14,"312":14,"313":14,"314":55,"315":14,"316":56,"317":16,"318":39,"319":34,"320":40,"321":36,"322":38,"323":36,"324":36,"325":7,"326":-1,"327":-1,"328":5,"329":5,"330":5,"331":5,"332":22,"333":57,"334":57,"335":8,"336":36,"337":5,"338":37,"339":7,"340":36,"341":37,"342":36,"343":38,"344":36,"345":7,"346":36,"347":33,"348":41,"349":34,"350":35,"351":5,"352":7,"353":36,"354":37,"355":36,"356":36,"357":36,"358":36,"359":7,"360":38,"361":33,"362":7,"363":33,"364":34,"365":40,"366":36,"367":47,"368":48,"369":-1,"370":16,"371":58,"372":20,"373":5,"374":46,"375":43,"376":44,"377":45,"378":51,"379":43,"380":43,"381":43,"382":43,"383":1,"384":24,"385":59,"386":15,"387":25,"388":25,"389":26,"390":60,"391":60,"392":60,"393":61,"394":61,"395":59,"396":59,"397":59,"398":59,"399":59,"400":57,"401":16,"402":16,"403":17,"404":18,"405":17,"406":17,"407":17,"408":50,"409":62,"410":62,"411":4,"412":17,"413":17,"414":18,"415":17,"416":17,"417":17,"418":58,"419":52,"420":53,"421":54,"422":14,"423":16,"424":16,"425":14,"426":55,"427":14,"428":56,"429":39,"430":33,"431":34,"432":40,"433":36,"434":38,"435":7,"436":36,"437":36,"438":36,"439":7,"440":0,"441":0,"442":23,"443":63,"444":63,"445":45,"446":43,"447":44,"448":43,"449":43,"450":43,"451":43,"452":8,"453":17}}
